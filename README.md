# üîç Interpolation Search Visualizer

An interactive, web-based tool designed to make the Interpolation Search algorithm easy to understand. This visualizer provides a step-by-step breakdown of the search process, the formula, and the logic behind each guess.

## ‚ú® About The Project

Understanding search algorithms can be abstract. This project aims to demystify Interpolation Search by turning its mathematical formula into a simple, intuitive, and visual process.

Instead of just showing the code, this tool explains *how the algorithm thinks*. It uses the analogy of looking for a name in a phone book‚Äîyou don't start at the beginning to find a name starting with 'S'; you guess its position proportionally. This visualizer does the same for numbers.

## üöÄ Features

* **Interactive Array Display:** Watch `low`, `high`, and `probe` pointers move in real-time.
* **Live Formula Breakdown:** A unique panel that breaks down the interpolation formula into plain English steps, showing how values are calculated in each iteration.
* **Step-by-Step Log:** A clear, running commentary of the algorithm's decisions.
* **Custom & Random Data:** Input your own numbers or generate a random array with a single click.
* **Single-File Application:** No complex setup needed. Everything is in one HTML file.
* **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built with vanilla web technologies, keeping it simple and accessible.

* **HTML:** For the core structure.
* **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** For modern and responsive styling.
* **JavaScript:** For all the algorithm logic and DOM manipulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

**Using the Live Demo:**
